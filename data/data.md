# Data
Data used in this project are from "A Benchmark Dataset for SSVEP-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces" [1] research project.

This paper introduces a benchmark dataset for SSVEP (steady-state visual evoked potential) using a brain-computer interface (BCI) with a 40-target speller. It includes 64-channel EEG data from 35 subjects performing tasks with a virtual keyboard using joint frequency and phase modulation. Frequencies range from 8 to 15.8 Hz. The dataset, valuable for comparing stimulus coding and target identification methods in SSVEP-based BCIs, is also useful for system design and computational modeling. It is accessible for download [here](http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html).
