# SSVEP-Classification

In this project, we conducted an extensive analysis of Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. We explored various signal classification methods, including traditional train-free techniques like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and its variants, as well as deep learning approaches using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and EEGNet. Using a dataset from 35 subjects, we focused on developing and evaluating these methods. Our work compared the performance of traditional and modern classifiers in terms of accuracy and Information Transfer Rate (ITR), noting consistent accuracy across different subjects.
